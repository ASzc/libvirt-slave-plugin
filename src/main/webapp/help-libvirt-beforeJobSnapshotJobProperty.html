        Enter the name of a snapshot that virtual machine nodes will be reverted to before this job runs on them. It is recommended that you use labels to restrict which nodes this job runs on, unless all of your nodes are compatible. Consistent naming of snapshots between the allowed nodes is important for this feature to operate correctly. The virtual machine nodes must be configured for a single executor with this option defined, otherwise a job starting on one executor will interrupt the jobs running on the others. This value will override any general pre-job snapshot defined in the node's configuration.
